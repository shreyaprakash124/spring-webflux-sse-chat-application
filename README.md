## General info
Server-Sent-Events, or SSE for short, is an HTTP standard that allows a web application to handle a unidirectional event stream and receive updates whenever the server emits data.
In this project, we make use of implementations such as the Flux class provided by the Reactor library, or potentially the ServerSentEvent entity, which gives us control over the events metadata.

Flux is a reactive representation of a stream of events â€“ it's handled differently based on the specified request or response media type. An SSE is a specification adopted by most browsers to allow streaming events unidirectionally at any time.
The **events** are just a stream of UTF-8 encoded text data that follow the format defined by the specification.

## Thought process and problem statement
This application is designed to provide the user with a real-time one an one chat platform .
The idea is to take advantage of the Reactive Stream Specification to build a non-blocking reactive chat application. 
In this case, I've achieved a non-blocking operation using Spring's web-flux framework and implemented Server-Sent-Events(SSE) in java spring.
For the desired result I established a stream connection based on the channel Id the purpose of the channel Id is to create a chat group in which one or more user can send/receive messages.
